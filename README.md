# T.P.
T.P. is a short virtual reality horror-adventure game about a bathroom housing an interdimensional portal in the toilet. Before Halloween 2019 I told my friend and collaborator [Michael Vaughn Green](http://raptorsrevenge.com/index.php) that if he created a fake horror movie poster for a game called "Terror Piss" that I would make a game for it. He made this [image](http://raptorsrevenge.com/tp/TP_coverArt_001.png) and I took it from there.
